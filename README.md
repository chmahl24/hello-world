Github intro

# Hello world! I am fairly new to using Github as a contributor, but look forward to start doing so. I wouldn't say I'm proficient in any language, but I am always learning more. Here's a few of the top languages and projects I'm working on:
# Android Studio Developer Kit (SDK) and therefore Java
# adb
# Ruby
# SQL
# Python 3.x
# Kali Linux/Metaspoit
